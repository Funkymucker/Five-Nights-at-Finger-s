Welcome to Five Nights at Finger's for python. If you're familiar with 'Five Nights at Freddy's' then you probably get the general idea.

My friend & I made this thing during school when we had nothing better to do. We ended up making a couple sequels to this game, but none of them were ever finished, so I probably wont post them.

THe basic idea is that you play as Walter White / Heisenberg, stuck in a building with Mike Ehrmantraut / Finger. You have to survive 5 nights in order to beat the game.

The gameplay loop relies on using the keyboard to make decisions on whether you want to:
1) Check the cameras
2) Check the lights for the door in front of you to see if finger is there
3) Open or Close the door in front of you to prevent Finger's entrance

I find that we made the difficulty progression very good, and I've been able to beat the game a couple times, and its always tense at the end which im proud of

Anyway, After every night, the remaining power leftover is used to cook meth, and the money you receive from it can be used to gain upgrades. Namely a 10% power upgrade and a Finger detector which replaces the camera system

After five nights the game is over and you can stop playing, but there are a few secret nights which can be unlocked with secret codes. There are no hints to the secret codes, but you can also just open the python file to find them I bet

Also, this is obviously a parody of Breaking Bad.
